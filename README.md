<b><u>Introduction</i></b>

Ball Destiny is a mobile game that aimed at presenting the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms (AIML). It primarily targets to senior elementary and junior secondary students. The game requires no particular scientific background. Thus, it can also interest the general public curious about AIML. 
AIML knowledge is taught in University; the game shall benefit secondary students to learn relevant knowledge earlier, in order to strengthen their computing and algorithmic competence in university. 

<b><u>Game Design</i></b>

The game is designed as 2D Graphic mobile game with physical nature. This game aims at leveraging the concise 2D gaming experience to enhance studentâ€™s interest on AIML subjects and brainstorm their mind for creating new algorithms. Colour and shape of balls are designed as the concept of datasets in machine learning. By catching falling object, drawing lines and guessing the pattern, players can study the AIML process theory through the gaming experience.

<b><u>Game Mode</i></b>

The game application can be divided into eight different modes including the recent research - Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Linear Regression, K-means Clustering, Decision Tree, Local Search, Evolution, and Neural Network. Each mode contains a number of levels. Current methods are the common concepts in AIML development; the game will extend new modes for more AIML algorithms. 

<b><u>Education with Ball Destiny</i></b>

Ball Destiny provides a meaningful and authentic game experience in and outside the classroom. Besides learning from lecture and studying with textbooks, the game can also be an introduction tool of AIML in STEM session.
